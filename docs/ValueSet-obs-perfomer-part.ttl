The responsible party is not necessarily present in an action, but is accountable for the action through the power to delegate, and the duty to review actions with the performing actor after the fact.  This responsibility may be ethical, legal, contractual, fiscal, or fiduciary in nature.<br/>\n                        \n                           Example: A person who is the head of a biochemical laboratory; a sponsor for a policy or government program.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/v3/ParticipationType/cs.html#v3-ParticipationType-VRF\">VRF</a></td><td>verifier</td><td>A person who verifies the correctness and appropriateness of the service (plan, order, event, etc.) and hence takes on accountability.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/v3/ParticipationType/cs.html#v3-ParticipationType-AUTHEN\">AUTHEN</a></td><td>authenticator</td><td>A verifier who attests to the accuracy of an act, but who does not have privileges to legally authenticate the act.
